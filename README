Title: SequenceAlignment
Author: Nicholas Fiacco
Date: 03/08/2016

Description:
This independent project creates a Profile Hidden Markov Model using a Multiple Sequence Alignment
(MSA) in SELEX format, which can be obtained from the PFAM database, as training data. It then uses
this model to determine the optimal alignment of a query sequence of arbitrary to this model,
and determines the likelihood that this sequence is a member of the family represented by 
the MSA. There is also infrastructure to perform forward-backward smoothing, but as discussed
in the report this is not an effective analysis given the nature of the transitions in the model.

Execution Instructions:
1) download the repository
2) navigate to the root directory of the project
3) run the command: "java -jar exec/SequenceAlignment.jar"

Directory Contents:
  src -	contains all of the source code
  bin -	contains the compiled executables
  doc -	contains the report and LaTex file
  data -	contains the training data
  etc -	contains implementation notes and sample output
