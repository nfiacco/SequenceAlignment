Title: SequenceAlignment
Author: Nicholas Fiacco
Date: 03/08/2016

Description:
This project creates a Profile Hidden Markov Model using a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
in SELEX format, which can be obtained from the PFAM database, as training data. It then uses
this model to determine the optimal alignment of a query sequence of arbitrary to this model,
and determines the likelihood that this sequence is a member of the family represented by 
the MSA. There is also infrastructure to perform forward-backward smoothing, but as discussed
in the report this is not an effective analysis given the nature of the transitions in the model.

Usage:
There is a main method in the MarkovModel.java file, so if you compile and run MarkovModel
you will probably get what you want.  For ease, simply download the entire file structure,
and from the command line navigate to bin and run: java sequence.MarkovModel.

Directory Contents:
src	contains all of the source code
bin	contains the compiled executables
doc	contains the report and LaTex file
data	contains the training data
etc	contains implementation notes and sample output
